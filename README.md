# store_search

StoreSearch - another iOS app originally created by Matthijs Hollemans.

This is a search app to help you find products sold on iTunes store with a keyword you provide.

Searches can be narrowed by category.

Each result contains the product details including images.

More complex effects, animations and behaviour than previous apps of mine were applied to this app. In addition, internationalisation (currently only English/Japanese), cross iOS device compatibility, mailer were added this time.

This is the last app I have made by copying his work. Thank you Matthijs for helping me learn a lot about iOS app development.

No goals have been set at the moment.
